# Learning-Management-System
The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based platform designed to facilitate online education by allowing students to access courses, track their progress, and purchase learning materials. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, this project provides an interactive interface for both students and administrators.
